/*Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and
write an if-else chain.

• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.*/
var alien_color1 = 'red';
if (alien_color1 === 'green') {
    console.log("The player just earned 5 points.");
}
else {
    console.log("The player just earned 10 points");
}
